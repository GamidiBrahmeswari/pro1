Datatypes in javascript:

DATATYPES: JavaScript data types define the data type that a variable can store. 
there are  two types of data types in js:
1. Primitive Datatype
2. Non-Primitive Datatype

1.Primitive Datatype:

*It stores only single values.
* Primitive Immutable datatypes are immutable means they cannot change values once declared.
* primitive datatypes include number
                              string
                              undefined
                              Boolean
                              null
                              biginit
                              symbol
2.Non-primitive Datatype:

*non primitive datatypes are mutable means change the  values when declared also

*non primitive datatypes include array
                                  object
                                  functions
                                  regexp
                                  sets & maps

a;--->declaration

a=33;---> assigning

var a=55; --->intialisation

In 4 ways we can declare the varaiables,they are:

1. automatic--->it can't use

2. var--->recommended in few cases only

3. let--->highly recommended

4. const--->based on some requirements


Declaring multiple:

var a,b,c;
a=10;
b=20;
c=30;
console.log(a,b,c);
o/p:a=10;b=20;c=30;


difference between undefined and null:

undefined: means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

null:it is an assignment value, meaning that a variable has been declared and given the null value.





1. What is the value of typeof typeof  true?
     	 String(true is a type of Boolean and it is type of string)

2. What is the result of null == undefined?
     	 True(null is a empty value and undefined has no value)

3. What is the value of +''?
    	 0 (an operator converts an empty string to a number)
 
4. What is the result of [] == false?
True  /*(an empty array is zero and false is zero)*/

5. What is the value of {} + {}?
[object object][object object]  (because  it is the object)

6. What is the value of typeof 42n?
Big int(42n is the bigint)

7. What is the result of "" == false?
True(empty string changes to false )

8. What is the value of Boolean("0")?
 True(non-empty string is always true)

9. What is the result of [] === []
False(both are arrays but they are different memory allocation)
10. What is the value of typeof Infinity?
	Number( infinity is a number)
11 What is the result of {} === {}?
	False(both are objects with different memory allocation)
12. What is the value of typeof NaN?
	Number(NaN  is  also a special number)
